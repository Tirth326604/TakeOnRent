It is quite evident that most people would like to have a flexible and cost-effective method to obtain a product when they need it and return the product when the product is no longer required. The application - TakeOnrent is a rental application where we aim to achieve a similar objective. The main objective of the application is to provide users with an easy-to-use rental service. Users would like to rent based on multiple factors. Renting allows you to avoid unnecessary investment, maintenance, and other expenses. Renting allows you to get the equipment you need when you need it, which is more efficient than buying and seeing your assets decay in value while they aren't in use. TakeOnRent offers the right product for the job, resulting in increased efficiency. Product is maintained regularly, and rental assures that the product is of excellent quality and reliability while on-site. Renting gives the user flexibility by allowing them to rent for a short, medium, or long period.

The application has several features including user management, preference management (keeping the user’s preference in mind based on the interested categories), community forum (any user of the application can view the posts related to the products based on the category with latest updates), messaging service (user can message owner regarding the product to rent), reviews (Owner’s review and the product’s review), analytics (statistics of the user’s behavior to rent), billing and payment, insurance (option to opt for insurance for the selected product), product catalogue, cart management, product setup, and coupon management (option to add coupons for discounts to the rental products from the owner).
